<!-- only puzzle scene and dog scenes are build ready; because of how quickly we had to iterate to the next versions the architecture of this entire project is
 very broken. other scenes (the ones present in the version 1 demo/mid-project check in) would require heavy modification of scripts to build properly.-->

## Project Status

This project contains multiple scenes, but only the puzzle scene and dog scenes are currently build-ready. Due to the rapid iteration required during development, the overall architecture of the project has significant issues. Other scenes, such as those from the version 1 demo AKA mid-project check-in, would need substantial script modifications to function correctly in a build. The zip file for all builds are linked below.
